I have a bad memory and a lazy personality, most of my Internet passwords are the same. I knew it's a really horrible and dangerous habit, so I spent all my afternoon managing these annoying passwords.

I classify all the passwords into three categories: Strong, Regular and Weak.

* **Strong PW**: Use for very IMPORTANT products such as Mail, Internet Banking, Alipay, etc. Password should be as  complecated as possible, including numbers, signs and upper/lower case letters.

* **Regular PW**: Use for some regular websites and apps, the password doesn't have to be very complecated, so I took a password good to remember, easy to input and hard to be hacked.

* **Weak PW**: Use for some forums and communities, you don't have to worry even your password is missing, so I took an very easy password for them.

Now I have more than three passwords, I'm afraid that someday I will foget all of them, so I found an open-source passwords management software called [KeePass][1]. (I don't trust in [LastPass][2] coz it saves all the passwords in its database)

Then, unziped it into my USB disk and saved all my passwords in it, I also made a backup and uploaded it to the Cloud.

DONE.
