>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act, but a habit. â€“ Aristotle

Theses days I've been thinking about this words, excellence is a habit. I don't like falling behind, it feels like watching people swiming in the sea, while you just playing in the pool. However, it's really hard to form this habit, so I try to make some rules for myself here.

##**HABIT**

I've been told that habits are all formed before 20s-year-old, here is my habits list:

* Coding
* Reading Books
* Listening to Music
* Watching Movies
* Taking photos
* Excecising

Doubtfully and confirmedly, I put coding on the top, because I am way too far from excellent in coding area. All these ordinary and rich habits are enough to fullfil my time, so what's more important is to make a resonable plan and execute it strictly.

There are too many things to expand here, so I just write things about coding here, coz professional knowledge are so important in my short life.

##**LEARNING**

After entering college, students are told to learn by themselves, self-learning is so important, especially in IT area, so how to learn by yourselves correctly is the precondition of keeping excellent.

First of all, self-learning is a active work, if you study just because other people tell you to learn something, or any job needs you to learn something, it's all passive. Active self-learning should be planned, based on your develop directions or goals, checking your knowledge architecture termly, adding new knowledge and look up what's less, then make a plan to study.

Then, try your best to use search engine, read excellent people's posts and books, and make english materials your first choice.

At last, participate in practice when learning, even if it's just an easy algorithm in new language, or a little demo in new framwork, it's good to take practice.

##**GOALS n PLANS**

Keep excellent is just a abstract long-term goal, you should divide your goal into three goals and the difficulty of every goal should be moderate.

* Short-term Goal: weeks to months, with a spacific goal ilke build a personal blog environment in 1 week, finish reading *Programming Pearls* in 1 month...
* Medium-term Goal: months to years, with a little abstract goal like become a Ruby master in 3 year...
* Long-term Goal: at least 5 years, with a abstract goal like vecome a product manager in 7 years...

After making these goals you should write a plan, and record conclusions and prospects in every stage. If time allows, plan things everyday and execute it.

##**EXECUTION**

Life is changeable, unexpected things happen everyday, when executing plan you should avoid from these things:

* do favourite things first
* do easy things first
* do interesting things first
* do urgent things first

The right way is to sort all things by weight, usually we sort things emotionally, but you should try your best to make it rationally. But stick to one rule: Never leave things till tomorrow.

##**END**

Persistence makes success, I hope when I read this post again, I would clap my shoulder and say, good Job.
