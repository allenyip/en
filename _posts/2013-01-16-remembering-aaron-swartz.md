Jan 11th 2013ï¼Œ[Aaron Swartz][1] killed himself in his New York apartment at the age of 26. This suicide is being focused by involing lots of sensitive information such as copyright, hacker, goverment, etc.

I didn't know Aaron until I googled his life and experience. I begin to respect and regret about this young coder. Aaron Swartz takes a great influence on Internet: developed RSS, co-founded [Reddit][2], invented [web.py][3] framework... the language "Markdown" I'm writing now is also created by him.

It's such a smart coder who hacked the PACER database and posted many papers in public in 2009. He was arrested after hacking the MIT JSTOR database, downloading nearly 5 million papers and articles in 2011. Aaron Swartz is strongly supporting the freedom of information transmission. For this he paid great efforts as well as heavy prices.

This young genius has so many tags: writer, coder, hacker, liberalist, Internet activist... But in my opinion he is like a gloomy artist, died along and left us a valuable fortunes. Howerver, Aaron Swartz couldn't live "long and prosper" like [Vincent Van Gogh][4]. A death of a coder is just a obituary from media to his readers in this fast age.

[Tim Berners-Lee][5], the father of Internet, mourned on twtter  days ago: 
>Aaron dead. World wanderers, we have lost a wise elder. Hackers for right, we are one down. Parents all, we have lost a child. Let us weep.

Thank you, Aaron Swartz. I will never forget you and your spirit.
