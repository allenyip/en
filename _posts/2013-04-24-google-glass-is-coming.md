The Explorer Edition of Google Glass is now delivering to those rich lucky developers. After regreting my ordinary past, I can only go to [here](http://www.google.com/glass/start/) to "see" how it feels...

##**Hardware**

Essentially, Google Glass is a hardware just like phones and pads, the technical specification looks good, but in my opinion, Google has a really bad sense of hardware designing, the appearance of Google Glass is not so elegant but really geeky as I see. In fact, it just a single frame with a mini screen, barely not a really glass. Luckily, a "great" idea came to designers' head and they just put Ray-Ban lens on it to make it "cooler".

Google Glass has five different colors: black/orange/gray/white/blue, which is called Charcoal/Tangerine/Shale/Cotton/Sky, respectively. It's surprisingly fot me that as a black-gray-white lover, I like the Sky color most.

The price of this glass is still a secret, but I guess it won't be low coz the Explorer Edition "sells" $1,500. Although there's a rumor says it will go down to $800 when it releases, I still need to save money from now on to get one.

##**Software**

With this glass you can easily take photos or videos anytime anywhere you want, this is so great. (But I really hate the starting mode like " OK, glass...") If the energy and storage can easily support 24 hours and 7 days' shooting, the story of Black Mirror S01E03 may become true. (Sometimes I really think that the evolution of technology is devoluting people.)

It seems that you can't interact with Google Glass without fingers and voices, but [TNW](http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/04/22/google-glass-code-hints-at-spatial-gestures-including-two-finger-browser-zoom-and-winking-to-take-a-photo/) says it may also support eyes and head gestures, which is really cool. For me, an interesting and useful AR(Augmented Reality) application is more important than ways of inputing it supports. For example, the screen can show the weather status automatically when you look up into the sky, who can hate this kind of application?

The contest of #ifihadglass is just finished, lots of interesting [entries](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/glass/) show us what Google Glass can do.

It makes sporting cooler:

Also it makes working interesting:

Or even make your grades better:

(Other scenarios concluded by this [dude](http://www.giftsy.co/ifihadglass) are also very interesting.)

Although the Mirror API of Google Glass is seems to be limited, with the development of this product, all these interesting applications will get closer to us soon.

##**Ending**

I'm not sure that Google Glass will take us into the age of wearable device, but I think we never took it so serious before, various of tech products are changing the way we live, I hope we are changing in a good way, with Google Glass our descendants would never ever look like this:

Alas, I hope Google releases it soon so I can really feel it.
