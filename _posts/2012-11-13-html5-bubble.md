Days ago I did a [report](http://allenyip.github.com/HTML5/template/index.html) about HTML5 in my lab, briefly introduced some technological attributes of HTML5. I think most developers like this new tech, some of them even want to throw their iOS/Android/WinPhone projects away and write an HTML5 app that every platform can run.

However, this idea is so beautiful in mind but so unrealistic in life, just like HTML5 itself. Nowadays, HTML5 still has many shortages and gets a long way to become new standard. Seems like its low development sppeed doesn't match its high attention.
 
When was HTML5 became so popular? I think this public [letter](http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/) wrote by Steve Jobs in 2010 is a fuse, it's also a typical case of celebrity effect. Since then, all the media keep publishing news or rumors about HTML5 and all the big companies keep making strategy about HTML5. More than two years have gone, HTML5 hasn't become a "new open standard" like Steve predicted. What's worse:

>July 2012, WHATWG and W3C stoped developing HTML5 together, HTML5 devided into two different standards.

>September 2012, Facebook moved their focus from HTML5 app to native app, Mark Zuckerberg even admitted that "their biggest mistake with mobile was bettin too much on HTML5". ([TC](http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/mark-zuckerberg-our-biggest-mistake-with-mobile-was-betting-too-much-on-html5/))

Behind the enthusiasm, we need more rational thinking, not blind following, HTML5 is the future trend and worth for focusing and learning, but spend most energy on it? I think all of us should slow down and really think about it.
