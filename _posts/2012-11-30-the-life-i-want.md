>From tomorrow on  
I will be a happy man  
Grooming, chopping 
and traveling all over the world  
From tomorrow on  
I will care foodstuff and vegetable  
Living in a house towards the sea  
with spring blossoms  

>From tomorrow on  
write to each of my dear ones  
Telling them of my happiness  
What the lightening of happiness has told me  
I will spread it to each of them  

>Give a warm name for every river and every mountain  
Strangers, I will also wish you happy  
May you have a brilliant future  
May your lovers eventually become spouse  
May you enjoy happiness in this earthly world  
I only wish to face the sea, with spring flowers blossoming  

Jan 13th 1989, [Haizi][1] wrote this poem. Two mouths later, he killed himself on the railway.

It's really inappropriate for me, an engineering student, to think about the meaning of life. But recently, I could't help thinking a question all the time, even when I was terribly busy.

>Is this the life you want? 

I asked this question to some persons around me, they gave me either surprised faces or negative answers. Then I got a conclusion that most of the people are not so happy and some people don't even know what they want. 

So I made a list about what I want recently:

* Begin a healthy and regular life
* Learn new languages and frameworks
* Participate in agile and funny projects
* Stop doing odds and ends or wasting time
* Read all the tech news
* Study and prepare exam intently
* ...

There are no romantic words like Love&Peace or Travel around the world in my list, which make me feel uncomfortable, I begin to wonder if I became realistic with the age or the lack of life experience drained my imagination. It's killiing me that romantic and innocence are fading away from me but nothing I can do with it.

But I think, happiness has little to do with what kind of life you live, but depends on what you feel when you live, just like [Alain de Botton][2] says in his book [_The Art of Travel_][3] :

>People are not happy only because he didn't know how to stay quietly in his room.

Finally, annoying November was gone, wish me a quiet December.
