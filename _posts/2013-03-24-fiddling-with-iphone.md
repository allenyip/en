title: How to Fiddle with iPhone Properly

layout: post

---
Product makes me uncomfortable after it gets too many users, the popularity of iPhone is torturing people who have buring desire of monopolizing. Therefore, some people tried best to make their iPhones look different, with different mobile cases, different dust plugs, different screen protectors...That is totally a wrong way I won't take, what I do to my iPhone is much more low-key than that: I fiddle with its desktop.

##**Wallpaper**

Fist thing to do is changing wallpaper, mavericks never use original wallpaper.

**Factors**

Wallpapers I like should comply with the following: 

* **Concise**: You know it...

* **Supporting Role**: Icons on screen are leading roles, wallpaper can not be too eye-catching.

* **Dark Color**: Most of icons are bright color, so a dark color wallpaper is more resonable.

* **Design**: Pure color wallpaper is boring and rigid.

Besides, since lock screen and main screen have different interfaces(lock screen can ignore Factor 2), a single wallpaper usually can not satisfy both, so these two wallpapers must be different but similar.

**Access**

It would be gorgeous if you could design your own wallpaper, if not, we can get them in these ways:

* **Artists**:Follow the designers, illustrators or photographers you like, remember to notice the size or copyright problem.

* **Wallpaper Apps**: There are so many great wallpaper apps in App Store, such as [Kuvva][1] and [每日壁纸杂志][2].

* **Wallpaper Sites**: Many Web sites provide wallpaper for iPhone too, check [poolga][3] or [iDesigniPhone][4].

And of course, google has some surprises like [this][5].

##**App**
For those users don't like jail-breaking, it's a pity that we can't change the app icon, however, we can dicide what apps can be installed and how to organize them.

How to organize the app to make it beautiful and useful at the same time? Here's my opinion: 

* **Less Folder**: We all know folers can improve efficiency, but they are too ugly to use.

* **Organize By Color**: It's the simplest way to make desktop beautiful, but you should remember the premise: find the app you want quickly.

* **Frequently-used App First**: Apps you use frequently should be considered first, especially beautiful ones.

* **Click Hotspots**: We often use mobile in one hand, put your favourite apps in hotspots.

##**My Desktop**

App organized:

I put apps by Apple in Screen 1, favourite apps in Screen 2 and 3, and other apps in Screen 4.

~~The wallpaper I'm using now is created by [cha研][6] from Weibo, You can download in [here][7]. (Can't stop playing cute...~~

UPDATE ON 3/31: Stop playing cute, new wallpaper modified from Jimsy's [work][12] on Dribbble.

PS: Aesthetics is subjective, this post just represent my persional and current view.
