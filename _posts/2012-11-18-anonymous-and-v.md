>We are Anonymous  
We are legion  
We never forgive  
We never forget  
Expect us. — Anonymous

After the Israel Defense Forces took military action in the Gaza strip against Hamas this week, Anonymous made a [fight](http://tnw.to/c0S0e) back, leaked thousands of email addresses and passwords, hacked hundreds of Israeli Web sites, and deleted databases belonging to Bank Jerusalem and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

[Anonymous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group)) is a decentralized network of individuals focused on promoting access to information, free speech, and transparency. As the biggest hacktivist group in the world, Anonymous has declared many events these years, making them get supported by lots of netizens and get guarded by goverment. (FYI: You can't find positive news about Anonymous inside GFW)

Each time I heard news about this organization, I can't help thinking the movie [_V for Vendetta_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434409/), thinking the man in the mask, thinking the touch and the shock this movie gave me. I hope everyone in Anonymous is V, persuing equality, justice and freedom, even their final goal is a virtual Utopia.

In my opinion, Hackers are smart, selfless, rebel, They have a high spiritual pursuit and believe in some kind of creed, which is precisely concluded by [Steven Levy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Levy):

>* Access to computers—and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works—should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!
* All information should be free  
* Mistrust authority — promote decentralization
* Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not criteria such as degrees, age, race, sex, or position  
* You can create art and beauty on a computer
* Computers can change your life for the better

Anyway, what we want and all we do has only one purpose: To make this world better.
