There's no doubt that iPhone has changed the way people interact with mobile devices, accomplished a revolution from keyboard-input to touch-experience. However, with the success of mobile devices and the mature of muti-touch technology became, people are losing their curiousness about it and looking forward to next revoluion of interaction.

Some people begin to focus on these new technologies:

* **Haptic Interaction**：Using haptic feedback to create virtual reality
* **Eye Tracking**：Inputing by tracking the movements of eyes
* **Voice Recognition**：Including sound and silent recognition
* **Retinal Display**：Project the image to user's retinas.
* **3D Display**：With/without glasses
* **Flexible Display**：Display that light, thin, and flexible like paper
* **...**  

Some companies even release commercial products:

* **Body Detection**：Wii, PS3, Kinect...
* **Wearable Devices**：Google Glass...
* **Voice Recognition**：Siri, Google Now...
* **...**

As two hotest products of next generation of interaction, Kinect is more input-oriented while Google Glass is more output-oriented. It seems like both of them are not so complete and perfect. Voice assistant like Siri or Google Now is more like an unskilled assistant. 

All of these products still got a long way to accomplish a revolution. Yet, Wearable devices like Google Glass is becoming more and more popular, since the Glass is still in development, I hope it can really amaze us in the near future.

I'is hard to create new products, we need brand new ideas and excellent engineers, but it's harder to make products popular or even revolutionary, we need great opportunities and clever operators. iPhone is just a perfect example. 

For Google Glass, there remains many questions: how to find appropriate inputing ways, how to make extraordinary apps, how to cut the price on the profits... Google can not build a closed end-to-end ecosystem like Apple, nor even opensource system like Android. It's important for Google to balance the pros and cons and build a harmonious world that producers, developers and comsumers all like.

The best product is always in the dream, but what we really need is touchable stuff, not ideal thoughts. I also believe that there are countless possibilities when we making our dreams come true.

Maybe we are not waiting for the next "iPhone", what we really wait are the next "iPhones", coz you know, there are so many surprises in the tech world :)
